This is the repository for Homework 6 Team assignment.

Use the instructions I handed out in class, but we will do a lot of this in class to make
sure everyone has the process down.

Team leader will fork the repository and add the team members as collaborators.
Each team member is to create a display like the SchaperConditionsDisplay.
Each team member will push their code to the team repository.
Once all team members have their code in the team repository, the team leader will issue 
a pull request.
